# ParallelFileProcessor
Developed a Java app to get Files in directory their Name, MD5 and Line Count using Multhreading and Swing for GUI.
Enter the directory either manually or through JFileChooser i.e through the "Dir" button.
Select number of Threads and select any/all of three in the filter(if you don't then it will give filename,MD5 and Line Count of every file in that directory).
Press Search and wait till the code fetches all the files in the given directory.
A JDialog with filename, MD5 and Line Count will pop up after some time (depends upon the number of files).
Hover your mouse over the any cell of first column and path of that file will be shown as a tooltiptext.
Double click any cell in the first column i.e. Filename and the Path of that file will be copied to your clipboard.
(Note :The Program might not work where administrator permission is required)
